Project #0: The Game
Overview
Let's start out with something fun—a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges – since you've already gotten your feet wet with a few small apps, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

Technical Requirements
Your app must:

HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.
Git 20+ commits Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README
Wireframe: - Basically draw out what your game will look like—very different way it could look. You can use paper or any wireframe tool you find online.
User Stories - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
The user click starts and the level starts
When the user hits the f key a fire ball is catuplulated at a target.
Render a game in the browser
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it (we will show you how)
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Be reasonably complex
Necessary Deliverables
A working MVP (minium viable product) what is the absolute bare minimum functionality for you game, do not make it more complex until you've completed your MVP.
A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
A README.md file with an explanation of what the project is and why you made it, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable). In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme.
Useful Resources
MDN Javascript Docs (a great reference for all things Javascript)
jQuery Docs (if you're using jQuery)
Github Pages (for hosting your game)
Project Feedback + Evaluation
Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score	Expectations
0	Incomplete.
1	Does not meet expectations.
2	Meets expectations, good job!
3	Exceeds expectations, great job!
This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but the more important scores are the individual ones above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

Suggested Ways to Get Started
Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
Use your Development Tools (console.log, element inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
During the day, work through problems in class & ask questions when you need to! We're here to help prevent you from burning through your time with wild goose chases. Add relevant code to your game each night too, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. There should be at least a couple dozen commits.
Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
Plan to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
